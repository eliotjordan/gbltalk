Topic ! - data types and stores


1. Much of this cribbed from the Geoserver Documentation Pages

http://docs.geoserver.org/stable/en/user/gettingstarted/shapefile-quickstart/index.html

2. Data hierarchy
	a. Workspace - a container used to group similar layers together.
		i. Name - unique identifier. E.g. pulmap at Princeton or druid at Stanford
		ii. Namespace URI - is an identifier describing the project. Usually an associated URL
	b. Data Store - a source for the data served out by Geoserver
		i. Divided into Vector and Raster sources
		ib. Describe vector?
		ii. Vector sources might include shapefiles, tables in a database, csv files
			- In our geoserver instace, we store our data in Postgresql database.
		ii. Raster sources include GeoTiff, ArcGrid coverage, rasters stored in a database
		iii. Plugins expand the range of available datasources. For instance, data stored in proprietary ESRI systems
			like ArcSDE or File Geodatabases can be used with a plugin. MIT
